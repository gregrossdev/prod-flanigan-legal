                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The truth about insurance companies is that they often have an adversarial
                        relationship with their policyholders. Many insurance companies teach their claims
                        adjusters to maximize company profits without regard to claimants and
                        policyholders’ interests.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Insurance companies are using artificial intelligence programs and analytics to lower
                        claim payment and increase corporate profits.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Insurance companies often delay making fair settlement offers in a deliberate
                        attempt to starve claimants into accepting less than they deserve.

                <ul>
                    <li> Insurance companies know that we know what they are. We have a track record of
                        taking the fight to insurers for violations of West Virginia’s Unfair Trade Practices
                        Act, Unfair Claim Settlement Practices Act and have uncovered thousands of pages
                        of internal documents from the nations largest insurance companies to show that
                        they engage in a deliberate strategy to reduce claim payment to increase the wealth
                        of their corporations.
