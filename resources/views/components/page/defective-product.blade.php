        Defective Product
        Each year, defective products cause injury to hundreds of thousands of people. It is
        illegal to make or sell an unreasonably dangerous product in West Virginia. When a

        consumer is injured at no fault of their own, the responsibility falls on the company that
        designed, manufactured, and sold the product. If you have been injured as a result of a
        defective product, a West Virginia defective product attorney can help you understand
        the process of seeking compensation through a product liability claim.
        Generally, there are three types of product defects:
        Design defect – something was defective in the product design
        Marketing defect – there were no warnings, or inadequate warnings, about the danger
        that caused the injury.
        Manufacturing defect – the product was manufactured incorrectly. It may have been
        designed correctly, but something went wrong in the manufacturing process.
        Product manufacturers and designers have a duty of care to ensure that their products
        are safe for the use they were intended for, and that they are adequately labeled
        informing users of possible hazards.
        If you believe you have a product liability claim, retain the evidence and call an
        experienced defective products lawyer immediately.
