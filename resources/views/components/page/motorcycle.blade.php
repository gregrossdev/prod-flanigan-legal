        Motorcycle Accident
        Motorcycles are as much a symbol of freedom as West Virginia’s country roads.
        Unfortunately, even the best riders are at risk.
        Even though there are around 50,000 motorcycles registered in West Virginia,
        motorcyclists are often still subjected to bias and the unfair stereotypes that by riding a
        motorcycle you accept a higher level of danger than those in other vehicles.
        Bottom Line: If you are hurt in a wreck that isn’t your fault, you have a right to full
        compensation for your injuries.
        The vast majority of motorcycle crashes occur because of the actions and
        inattentiveness of motor vehicle drivers.
        In 2019, there were 5,014 motorcyclists killed in traffic crashes in the U.S., a decrease
        from 2018 (5,038). Motorcyclist deaths accounted for 14% of the total highway fatalities
        nationwide that year. In West Virginia, motorcyclist deaths accounted for 11% of the
        total roadway fatalities in 2019.

        Driver neglect takes many forms:
        - Unsafe lane change – A risky lane change by a motorist is potentially deadly for
        an innocent motorcycle rider. Automobile drivers should always look at their
        surroundings, mirrors, and blind spots, and signal their intent to turn before
        changing lanes.
        - Failure to yield – Motorcycle accidents commonly occur at intersections,
        especially when drivers of passenger vehicles fail to see riders and fail to yield to
        their right of way. Failure to yield accidents are particularly common on right turns
        and with unprotected left turns. In fact, left turn accidents are the most common
        types of collisions involving motorcycles and cars.
        - Distracted driving – Driver distraction is a deadly threat to a motorcyclist. A
        driver who chooses to text or uses a cell phone chooses puts lives at risk.
        - Intoxicated driving – Drunk and drug abusing drivers are hazardous to every
        other motorist on the road and create a particularly high risk or injury and death
        for innocent riders.
