        Premises Liability
        In West Virginia, premises liability is generally defined as responsibilities placed upon
        owners and occupiers of property to keep their premises in a reasonably safe condition
        so as not to injure visitors to the property. If you have sustained an injury on someone
        else’s property due to that party’s negligence, you may qualify to receive compensation
        to cover the full cost of your injury.
        Examples of premises liability cases include:
        - Fires caused by the neglect of a property owner or manager.
        - Inadequate security and safety, in which a person is injured or assaulted due to
        the lack of protection (e.g., drowning accidents, exposure to toxic substances,
        criminal acts by third parties, etc.).
        - Vicious Pets, which entail a person keeping an animal they know is dangerous
        and allowing it to interact with guests.
        - Slip and fall cases, in which a person slips and falls on a spill or other substance
        in a building and sustains an injury.
        - Defective conditions, which usually entail broken objects (e.g., broken handrails,
        uneven steps, etc.) or misplaced items that cause a tripping hazard or some
        other type of hazard.
        - Snow and ice accidents, which occur when a person slips on ice or snow on the
        sidewalk or parking lot of a business.
        - Inadequate maintenance, in which a person is injured because the owners or
        managers of a property did not keep up with proper maintenance procedures
        (e.g., broken locks).
        - Water leaks or flooding resulting from carelessness or bad equipment.

        - Elevator or escalator accidents if defectiveness or another issue led to the injury.
        Property owners have an obligation to ensure the safety of their patrons from known
        dangerous conditions and criminal activity. A property owner not only has responsibility
        for removing dangerous hazards and materials from the property, but must also ensure
        that the design and construction of the building isn’t inherently dangerous. If you are
        interested in pursuing a personal injury lawsuit against an irresponsible property owner,
