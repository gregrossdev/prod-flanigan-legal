        Pedestrian Accidents

        According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there are
        more than 6,000 people killed each year in pedestrian accidents. The number of
        pedestrian deaths in West Virginia doubled, from 18 in 2020 to an estimated 36 in 2021.

        An estimated 7,485 pedestrians were struck and killed by drivers in 2021, the most
        recent full year of statistics available. It was the largest number in four decades,
        according to the association, which represents state highway safety offices.
        Pedestrians are by far the most vulnerable population on our streets. Accidents
        involving pedestrians often result in severe injuries such as spinal cord injuries,
        traumatic brain injuries, and sometimes death.
        At crosswalks, drivers must defer to pedestrians and drive cautiously when foot activity
        is expected. Pedestrians, unfortunately, pay the price when aggressive or distracted
        drivers ignore their responsibility.
        Common causes of Pedestrian Accidents include:
        - Driver speeding through a red light
        - Driver ignores stop sign
        - Driver texting on their phone
        - Illegally parked vehicles blocking pedestrian visibility
        - Intoxicated drivers
        - Driver inattention
        If you have been injured in a pedestrian accident, make sure you receive the financial
        compensation you may be entitled to for the losses your injuries have caused you.
