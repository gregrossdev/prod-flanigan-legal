        Medical Malpractice Cases
        Medical malpractice cases are some of the most challenging and difficult cases to win.
        The law often times works against victims, not for them.

        In 2016, experts at Johns Hopkins Medicine “calculated that more than 250,000 deaths
        per year are due to medical errors in the U.S.,” making it the third leading cause of
        death in this country.
        Every medical negligence case is evaluated on the merits. We deal with healthcare
        providers to gain access to pertinent medical records and any evidence which supports
        a claim of professional negligence.
        In each case, it is our responsibility to find a qualified physician and other specialists
        and experts to evaluate the case and testify.
        We also obtain experts to calculate things like the cost of necessary future medical
        care, lost income, and other damages. Each case is evaluated to access the extend of
        the loss of enjoyment of life and diminished activities.
        Medical malpractice cases include:
        - Inadequate staffing, training, or supervision of staff
        - Failure to provide necessary and timely treatment
        - Kickback or other financial schemes resulting in patient harm
        - Providing the wrong treatment
        - Failure to refer a patient to a specialist
        - Performing unnecessary surgery
        - Improper surgery / Mistakes during surgery
        - Persons performing functions beyond or outside of their training or privilege
        - Anesthesia negligence
        - Nursing negligence
        - Failure to monitor patients for developing problems
        - Delayed delivery
        - Medication errors
        - Failure or delay in determining the problem from which a patient is suffering
        (delay in diagnosis / misdiagnosis)
        - Failure to properly inform a patient what he or she needs to have done, including
        the benefits and risks of certain procedures or medications
        - Intentional or reckless wrongdoing
