        Traumatic Brain Injuries
        Traumatic brain injury occurs when a sudden force or trauma causes a disruption in
        normal functioning of the brain. Traumatic brain injuries can cause a lifetime of pain
        and misery for the injured person and their loved ones.
        Traumatic brain injuries often occur when the brain is driven into the side of the skull by
        a sudden blow or by the force of shaking or an acceleration/deceleration whiplash type
        injury. In some of these cases, the brain will suffer bruising and swelling in others the
        impact is so severe to cause intracranial bleeding.
        Every year, more than a million Americans sustain traumatic brain injury. About 50,000
        people die from traumatic brain injuries and approximately 80,000 more are left with
        lifelong disabilities.
        The symptoms of brain injury may take weeks or even months to fully develop. These
        symptoms include problems thinking, inability to concentrate, emotional and behavioral
        changes, speech problems, memory loss and loss of coordination. Severe traumatic
        brain injuries can cause result in coma and death.

        What is the difference between a mild, moderate, and a severe Traumatic Brain
        Injury?

        Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are classified as mild, moderate or severe and these
        phrases are very misleading as it is a fact that persons with a “mild” brain injury can
        have cognitive and behavioral issues that have a devastating effect on their lives. Mild
        TBI may also be known as concussion, minor head trauma, minor TBI, minor brain
        injury or minor head injury.

        Symptoms of mild TBI include:

        How Does a Traumatic Brain Injury Happen?
        The human brain is the consistency of warm butter, tofu, or gelatin inside our skull.
        Some people may intuitively think about it like a wet nerf football, but nothing could be
        further from the truth. For all of the complexity and design perfection of the human body,
        the inside of our skulls still contains sharp surfaces and ridges particularly in the area
        behind our nose bone.
        When the brain violently shifts inside the skull it can experience a primary (focal and
        diffuse) mechanical injury. What happens is that the exterior part of the brain impacts
        the inside surface or ridges of the skull. Due to the different acceleration rates of the
        denser white matter of the brain, and the more jelly-like density of the gray matter of the
        brain, shearing can occur in the microscopic nerve structures of the brain called axons
        and dendrites. The resulting damages to these structures on the border between the
        gray matter and white matter can be severe.
        The brain is suspended inside the skull in cerebrospinal fluid – a clear liquid that fills the
        brain and spinal cord. The cerebrospinal fluid can provide a barrier against impacts and
        shock to the brain. If the impact is severe enough, however, the brain can shift within its
        chamber of fluid and strike or bounce off the inside of the skull. The initial blow to the
        head can injure the brain (coup), as can the brain hitting the skull (contrecoup). A coup-
        contrecoup brain injury, therefore, refers to two individual brain injuries. A recent study
        found that that the odds of a favorable vs. unfavorable outcome for a patient with a
        coup-contrecoup injury were almost equal (48% and 52%, respectively).

        The secondary brain injury caused by the physiologic responses to the initial injury. In
        other words, the secondary effect of a traumatic brain injury is caused by the
        neurochemical effect on the brain. A single mild traumatic brain injury can lead to early
        dementia and Parkinson’s. Brain trauma has been shown to be a risk factor for
        developing Alzheimer disease (AD), and AD-like plaques containing amyloid-β (Aβ)
        peptides have been found in the brain shortly following trauma.

        and biological level. Lye et al., Traumatic Brain Injury as a Risk Factor for Alzheimer’s

        posttraumatic stress disorder.&quot; JAMA Neurol. 2018; 75: 1043-1044, 1055-1061.
        How Common are Traumatic Brain Injuries?
        According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly 65,000
        deaths relating to a TBI occurred in the United States in 2020. On average, there were
        176 TBI related deaths per day.
        https://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/data/index.html
        An estimated 1.7 million people sustain a traumatic brain injury each year.
        https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459300/ 223,135 required hospitalization.
        The financial costs (medical bills and lost productivity) associated with brain injuries are
        staggering. The CDC estimates the financial costs to be in the range of $78.5 billion
        dollars per year.

        What about Delayed Onset of Symptoms?
        The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirms that brain injury
        symptoms can start “days, weeks, or months after the trauma.” National Institutes of
        Health “Heads Up” Physician Brochure.
        https://www.cdc.gov/headsup/providers/index.html

        What is a mild-Traumatic Brain Injury?

        The American Academy of Neurology guidelines define “concussion or mild traumatic
        brain injury (MTBI)” as “a condition in which there is a traumatically induced alteration in
        mental status, with or without an associated loss of consciousness (LOC). A broader
        definition is a traumatically induced physiologic disruption in brain functions that is
        manifested by LOC, memory loss, alteration of mental state or personality, or focal
        neurologic deficits”. Other important factors include Retrograde and Post Traumatic
        Amnesia.

        What is a Concussion?
        The term Concussion and the onset of a Traumatic Brain Injury are now regularly
        interchanged as terms. Some doctors like to use the diagnosis of “post-concussion
        syndrome” for the long term effects of a concussion, while other doctors prefer to just
        use the diagnosis of Traumatic Brain Injury for the initial and long term effects.
        The Fourth International Conference on Concussion in Sport Held in Zurich,
        November 2012 consensus statement, in part, states:
        Concussion is a brain injury and is defined as a complex
        pathophysiological process affecting the brain, induced by biomechanical
        forces. Several common features that incorporate clinical, pathologic and
        biomechanical injury constructs that may be utilized in defining the nature
        of a concussive head injury include:
        1. Concussion may be caused either by a direct blow to
        the head, face, neck or elsewhere on the body with an
        &#39;impulsive&#39; force transmitted to the head.
        2. Concussion typically results in the rapid onset of
        short-lived impairment of neurological function that resolves
        spontaneously. However, in some cases, symptoms and
        signs may evolve over a number of minutes to hours.
        3. Concussion may result in neuropathological changes,
        but the acute clinical symptoms largely reflect a functional
        disturbance rather than a structural injury and, as such, no
        abnormality is seen on standard structural neuroimaging
        studies. Resolution of the clinical and cognitive symptoms
        typically follows a sequential course.
        4. Concussion results in a graded set of clinical
        symptoms that may or may not involve loss of
        consciousness. Resolution of the clinical and cognitive
        symptoms typically follows a sequential course.

        However, it is important to note that in some cases symptoms may be
        prolonged.
        … The diagnosis of acute concussion usually involves the assessment of
        a range of domains including clinical symptoms, physical signs, cognitive
        impairment, neurobehavioral features and sleep disturbance. Furthermore,
        a detailed concussion history is an important part of the evaluation both in
        the injured athlete and when conducting a pre-participation examination....
        ... The suspected diagnosis of concussion can include one or more of the
        following clinical domains:
        1. Symptoms—somatic (eg, headache), cognitive (eg, feeling
        like in a fog) and/or emotional symptoms (eg, lability);
        2. Physical signs (eg, loss of consciousness (LOC), amnesia);
        3. Behavioral changes (eg, irritability);
        4. Cognitive impairment (eg, slowed reaction times);
        5. Sleep disturbance (eg, insomnia).

        If any one or more of these components are present, a concussion should be
        suspected and the appropriate management strategy instituted.” (Emphasis Added)
        What health care providers traditionally treat brain injury patients?
        Patients who suffer a traumatic brain injury often require a multidisciplinary approach.
        Patients often benefit from a variety of doctors and therapists depending upon their
        symptoms and the severity of injuries. This can include psychologists, physical
        therapists, occupational therapists, vocational rehabilitation specialists, speech
        therapists, chiropractic doctors, naturopaths, neuropsychologists, physiatrists, functional
        neurologists, medical neurologists, neuroradiologists, neurosurgeons (in moderate and
        severe TBI cases), ophthalmologists specializing in traumatic brain injury vision
        disturbances, neuro-otologists, vestibular therapists, and potentially others.
