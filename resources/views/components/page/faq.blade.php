        Frequently Asked Questions
        If you have questions about personal injury cases, accident lawyers, and how to get
        financial recovery after a car accident or other incident, you’re not alone. We’ve
        gathered some of those commonly asked questions to help you get started.

        Do I need to hire an attorney?
        An attorney will advocate for you against the insurance companies, and can help
        maximize your recovery. Insurance companies know this is fact. For example,
        management consulting firm McKinsey and Company and Allstate have conspired to

        reduce attorney representation because attorney represented claims settled on average
        five times more than those without.

        Although you can try to handle your claim on your own, there is a serious risk the
        insurance company will be protecting its own interests, not yours. An attorney can help
        you navigate the many different insurance coverages that may apply, negotiate and
        resolve any liens that may exist against your case, ensure that your medical bills are
        properly paid, and assess and explain your options. Before you talk to the insurance
        company, talk to an attorney.

        If I call you, will there be any pressure to immediately sign a contract?
        No – absolutely not. Your decision to hire an attorney may be one of the most important
        decisions you will make in your life. It should not be taken lightly, and you should be
        very careful in choosing a lawyer.

        How much do you charge to review a case?
        An initial appointment with an attorney at Flanigan Legal, PLLC to discuss the facts of a
        potential case is free. You can also ask any questions you may have regarding your
        case. There is no obligation to choose our firm. In most cases, where it appears that
        the claim is meritorious, we will advance the costs necessary to investigate and
        prosecute the claim. In the event we undertake formal representation, any costs
        advanced are reimbursed to us at the conclusion of the case, assuming we are able to
        make a recovery on your behalf.

        What are your fees?
        We accept cases on a contingent fee basis, which means that we collect no attorney’s
        fee unless we succeed in recovering damages for you through settlement or trial. We
        also advance all costs and expenses involved in the investigation and proof of your
        case, and we only recover our expenses if we are successful on your behalf.

        What is a contingency fee?
        A contingency fee is a legal fee that is dependent upon the successful outcome of a
        claim. We represent clients on a contingent fee basis. If we recover money for you, our

        fee is a percentage of the amount recovered. The percentage typically ranges from 1/3
        to 40% depending on when the case is resolved and the total amount recovered. If we
        do not recover any money for your, then you owe us nothing.
        We believe in our clients causes and spend our own money to finance our clients’
        cases. We don’t make money unless our clients make money. One of the reasons that
        Flanigan Legal, PLLC utilizes contingency fee agreements is because lawsuits are often
        very expensive. Injured people rarely can afford to pay an attorney for service rendered
        on an hourly basis. If there is no recovery in a contingency fee case, we receive
        nothing. When there is a recovery, the ultimate total recovery provides a fund from
        which the attorneys’ fees are paid. Contingency fees are open to negotiation between
        attorney and client; however, in certain types of cases (e.g., claims against the Federal
        Government) maximum fee limits are established by law. Contingency fee agreements
        must be in writing signed by both the attorney and the client.

        What work will I have to do if I hire your law firm?
        You are not responsible for preparing your case for trial. It is your responsibility to
        provide our office with information that you have available to you, but you will not have
        to do work to prepare your case. That is our job. It’s a job we take seriously and we
        have spent years learning how to do.

        Do I have to go to court?
        We prepare every case as if it will be tried to verdict in court. Some cases resolve
        without litigation. Other cases are not. Our experience is that often to get the insurance
        available a lawsuit needs filed. If we have to file a lawsuit, then you may have to give a
        deposition, attend a mediation or court hearings. You may eventually have to testify at
        trial. We will discuss all possible options with you and will help you determine which is
        the best course of action to pursue in your particular case.

        Will my case go to trial?
        Not necessarily. Many people settle their claims in negotiation, but you need a strong
        legal team to ensure you receive a fair settlement. If their offers don’t meet your needs,
        you and your attorney may decide to file a lawsuit, which is the formal beginning of a
        court-based process that ends in trial. Many people are able to settle before trial, but if
        you can’t, it’s in your best interest to have an experienced attorney on your side during
        this process.

        How long does a personal injury case take?

        Our goal is to resolve every case as quickly as possible. It is impossible to predict how
        long any particular case will take to resolve. Every case is different. However, we can
        give you a more accurate estimate of how long your particular case will take.
        What is the time limit for me to make a claim?
        Different rules govern different types of cases. The statute of limitations (time limit for
        filing a claim in court) in West Virginia for a negligence claim is two years. The
        limitations period starts to run when the cause of action arises, the plaintiff knows, or by
        the exercise of reasonable diligence should know that the plaintiff has been injured, the
        identity of the entity who owed the plaintiff a duty to act with due care and who may
        have engaged in conduct that breached that duty and that the conduct of that entity has
        a causal relation to the injury.
        The statute of limitations for filing a lawsuit is sometimes complicated and you should
        consult with a West Virginia lawyer immediately if you are concerned about that you are
        approaching the time limit for filing a claim.
        To illustrate this point, in West Virginia, the statute of limitations for breach of a written
        contract is ten years. The time limit for breach of an oral contract is five years. The
        limitations period starts to run when the breach of contract occurs, or when the act
        breaching the contract is discovered. However, the limitations period for a sales
        contract under the Uniform Commercial Code is four years.
        The statue of limitations for an insurance bad faith case in West Virginia is one year for
        a bad faith claim based on a common law theory or a statutory theory under the West
        Virginia Unfair Trade Practices Act.
        It is impossible in this space to set forth the rules that apply in all cases. Where injury
        does not manifest itself for many years after an event or exposure (such as during a
        period of latency after exposure to harmful chemicals) the statute of limitations may not
        run for many, many years.

        What is the Statute of Limitations for Filing a Wrongful Death Claim in West
        Virginia?
        Although we know that this is an emotionally trying time for your family to go through, it
        is important to pursue legal action in a timely manner. In West Virginia, there is a two-
        year statute of limitations for wrongful death actions. West Virginia&#39;s discovery rule
        applies to wrongful death actions. Under the discovery rule, the statute of limitations
        begins to run when the plaintiff knows, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should
        know: (1) there is an injury; (2) the identity of the party who owed the injured party a
        duty to act with due care; and (3) the entity&#39;s conduct has a causal relation to the injury.
        We understand that dealing with the death of a family member is incredibly difficult
        emotionally and financially. We promise your case will be handled with compassion and

        integrity. It is beneficial for surviving parties to contact our team of wrongful death
        lawyers soon after the death occurs so that we can bring the full force of the law against
        those responsible.

        What Kind of Damages can be Collected in a Wrongful Death Case?
        In West Virginia, the damages a wrongful death claimant is entitled to as the surviving
        family member or dependent include loss of care, love, and protection, pain and
        suffering, loss of companionship, medical care, treatments, and hospitalization
        expenses, loss of income, funeral and burial expenses. Our West Virginia wrongful
        death lawyers understand that this is a difficult time for you and your family. It is
        recommended that families contact our wrongful death lawyers as soon as possible to
        expedite the legal process and ensure a positive outcome.

        Who Can Sue for Wrongful Death?
        In West Virginia, only the deceased’s personal representative (also referred to as an
        estate administrator/executor appointed by the court) can file the wrongful death claim.
        It is recommended that families contact our wrongful death lawyers as soon as possible
        to expedite the legal process and ensure a positive outcome.

        What is Wrongful Death?
        In West Virginia, a wrongful death lawsuit seeks damages when one person&#39;s death is
        another party&#39;s fault. This horrific scenario can arise in cases involving motor vehicle
        crashes, medical malpractice, intentional acts (including crimes resulting in death), work
        place accidents or any other type of fatal personal injury. It is recommended that
        families contact our wrongful death lawyers as soon as possible to expedite the legal
        process and ensure a positive outcome.

        What Should I Do Immediately Following an Auto Accident?
        Call 911. Stay at the scene of the accident. Provide law enforcement the information
        they request. If it is safe, you or another occupant of the automobile should photograph
        all of the vehicles involved in the crash. Document information about the circumstances
        surrounding the crash. If injured, please request immediate medical attention.
        Sometimes, injuries are not immediately felt after a crash and become painful in the
        days and weeks following an accident. Regardless of when you first feel discomfort, it
        is important to see a doctor right away.

        When should I seek medical care?
        You should seek medical care as soon as possible. Delays in treatment can be
        detrimental to your health and can adversely affect your recovery. Sometimes, injuries
        are not immediately apparent. If your injuries are immediately apparent, you should
        request emergency treatment at the scene. Some injuries are not immediately obvious.
        Often times, pain does not set in until hours, days or even weeks later. Regardless of
        when your pain begins, it is important to see a doctor right away so you can address
        and treat any injuries you might have. The longer you wait to see a doctor in the hope
        that your pain will resolve on its own, the more likely the insurance company will deny or
        minimize your claim.
