        Insurance Claim Practices
        Some insurance claims are handled promptly and fairly. These instances do not require
        an attorney. Every insurance company in America is required by law to honor their
        obligations to the policyholder under the terms of the contract. When an insurance
        company wrongfully delays, denies, or underpays your claim, we recommend that you
        consult with an experienced insurance claim attorney to review your options.
        Insurance companies have made billions and billions of dollars by delaying, denying
        and defending righteous claims. Insurance companies employ clever jingles “like a
        good neighbor …” “you’re in good hands…” but the truth is often far more sinister.
        When an insurance company unreasonably denies, delays or refuses to pay the full
        value of an insurance claim, it may owe you more than just the coverage you paid for.
        In West Virginia, an insurance company who engages in unfair claim settlement practice
        is responsible for the harm and inconvenience it caused by its misconduct. Under

        certain circumstances, an insurance company may be required to pay punitive
        damages.
        An insurance company has a tremendous advantage over its insureds. When tragedy
        strikes, an insured is in a vulnerable position. If an insurance company does not honor
        the insuring agreement and pay the claim fairly and promptly, the harm caused by the
        loss is multiplied. For example, when an uninsured driver injures someone in an
        automobile crash, their victim may be unable to work or earn an income because of
        physical injuries and resulting medical care. A small business owner who suffers a
        water loss may be unable to operate or meet payroll obligations to employees.
        Homeowner who suffer a fire loss may not have a safe place for their family to sleep at
        night. Because of the imbalance in the relationship between an insurance company
        and its insureds, the law imposes a duty on insurance company and forbids insurance
        companies from putting the insurance company’s interests (i.e., profits) ahead of the
        insured’s interests.
        These common tactics are employed by insurance companies who the fail to act with
        the utmost of good faith and fair dealing:
        Provide financial incentives to adjusters that are linked to corporate profit to create a
        claim culture that encourages paying the lowest amount possible to resolve claims.
        Teach their claims adjusters to maximize company profits.
        Use computer-driven claims systems to create low compensation offers to increase
        company profits.
        Deny claims outright without conducting a proper investigation.
        Delay settlements and defend their decision by forcing an expensive, drawn-out court
        battle if you don’t take their walk-away offer.
        Delay the processing or payment of a claim in the hope that the policyholder will give up
        and accept a lower settlement.
        Offer a settlement that is far below the full value of the claim, hoping that the
        policyholder will accept it due to financial pressure.
        Store information about your previous accidents, homeowner’s insurance claims, and
        settlements history to look for ways to refuse to pay legitimate claims.
        Fail to communicate with the policyholder about the status of their claim or provide a
        clear explanation for a denial or delay.
        Misrepresent or conceal right to compensation for future medical bills, lost earnings,
        quality of life, and emotional trauma.
        Misrepresent injuries by claiming they aren’t severe enough to be compensated.

        Make threats or using intimidation tactics to pressure the policyholder into dropping their
        claim.
        Demand you sign their medical authorization release forms to get unrelated health
        information to use against you.
