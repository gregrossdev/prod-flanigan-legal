        Truck Accident
        In most truck accident cases - especially those involving large trucking companies -
        defendants will have highly skilled lawyers on their side from the moment the collision
        occurs. Insurance companies routinely send lawyers to the scene of the crash for one
        purpose – damage control. If you or a loved one has been involved in a crash with a
        commercial motor vehicle, you need an attorney on your side as soon as possible to
        preserve evidence, deal with insurance companies and protect your best interests.
        Very few forces can match the devastating impact of an accident with a semi-truck.
        Large commercial vehicles have the potential to cause serious and catastrophic
        damages in a traffic accident and severe injuries to all individuals involved in the
        accident. The destructive combination of large mass and speed, along with the
        potential to impact many smaller vehicles, make the damage caused by out-of-control
        trucks much greater than most other highway accidents.
        Light trucks can be just as deadly. A total of 20,566 fatal car accidents involved light
        trucks in 2020, including 8,779 involving light pickup trucks. By contrast, semi trucks
        and other large trucks were involved in 4,482 fatal car accidents during the same year.

        Accidents involving 18-wheelers or other commercial motor vehicles can result in
        catastrophic personal injuries.
        Commercial trucks cannot stop as quickly or maneuver nearly as well as a car can.
        Common truck accident cases include:
         Trucking Regulations Violations –
         Fatigued Driving - The National Transportation Safety Board estimates that up
        to 40% of all trucking accidents are caused by driver fatigue. Truckers are
        routinely pushed to drive long hours in order to make their deliveries on time.
        As a result, they may break the FMCSA rules and regulations regarding rest
        breaks and driving time.
         Distracted Driving - According to the FMCSA, truckers who are texting while
        driving are 23 times more likely to cause a serious trucking accident. As such,
        truckers who are caught violating this rule are fined heavily and could be at risk
        of losing their commercial license.
         Speeding - It is estimated that 16% of all fatal trucking accidents are caused by
        a truck driver with at least one prior conviction for a speeding violation.
         Inadequate Driver Training - Trucking companies have a responsibility to
        ensure that their truck drivers are licensed and properly trained before allowing
        them to hit the road. Failure to do so can result in serious accidents and
        injuries. Improperly trained drivers are a liability and may make poor decisions
        in an emergency situation.
         Unsafe Practices under Hazardous Road Conditions
         Malfunctioning Equipment - In an effort to save money, some unscrupulous
        companies do not perform proper maintenance. They may unhitch rear brakes,
        refuse to change brake pads and tires on schedule or even allow dangerous
        vehicles back out on the road after failing an inspection.
         Truck Accidents Due to Fatigue - The National Transportation Safety Board
        estimates that up to 40% of all trucking accidents are caused by driver fatigue.
        Truckers are routinely pushed to drive long hours in order to make their
        deliveries on time. As a result, they may break the FMCSA rules and
        regulations regarding rest breaks and driving time.
         Unsecured Cargo - Shipping companies have a responsibility to load a truck
        correctly and safely to prevent serious accidents from occurring. Loads that are
        unbalanced, overweight, or unsecured can cause a semi-truck to lose control,

        rollover, jackknife, or fall off of bridges and trestles. Load-shifting accidents are
        almost always preventable.
         Trucking Defects - Truck accidents due to tire blowouts and break failures are
        not uncommon. Defective trucking parts can result in fires, tire blowouts, bolt
        failures, and explosions.
         Driving Under the Influence – Impaired drivers are dangerous drivers.
         Overloaded Truck Accidents – Overloaded cargo makes the truck top-heavy
        and risks a rollover crash. The cargo itself could also fall off, spreading debris
        on the road, cause an obstruction or even fall onto another vehicle.
         Truck Accidents Involving Wide Turns - One of the most common ways trucks
        may injure other drivers is by performing an unsafe wide turn, which may put
        other vehicles (unseen to the driver) in harm’s way.
         Blind Spot Truck Accidents - A report which was issued by the National
        Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in March of 2019 indicated that
        leading up to 2015, more than 500,000 accidents resulted from a blind spot
        issue. These crashes resulted in more than 188,000 injuries and more than
        500 fatalities.
